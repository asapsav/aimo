bedda4,Let $ABCD$ be a unit square. Let $P$ be the point on $AB$ such that $|AP| = 1/{20}$ and let $Q$ be the point on $AD$ such that $|AQ| = 1/{24}$. The lines $DP$ and $BQ$ divide the square into four regions. Find the ratio between the areas of the largest region and the smallest region.,480,1:1,"Error parsing answer: The key to solving this problem is to find the areas of the four regions and then find the ratio of the largest and smallest areas.

First, we find the area of the triangle $APQ$. The area of a triangle is given by the formula 

$$A = \frac{1}{2}bh$$

where $A$ is the area of the triangle, $b$ is the base of the triangle, and $h$ is the height of the triangle.

In this case, the base of the triangle is $AP = 1/{20}$ and the height of the triangle is $AQ = 1/{24}$. So, the area of the triangle $APQ$ is

$$A_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{20} \times \frac{1}{24} = \frac{1}{480}$$

Next, we find the area of the trapezoid $DPBQ$. The area of a trapezoid is given by the formula

$$A = \frac{1}{2}(h) \times (b_1 + b_2)$$

where $A$ is the area of the trapezoid, $h$ is the height of the trapezoid, $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the two bases of the trapezoid.

In this case, the height of the trapezoid is $AQ = 1/{24}$ and the two bases of the trapezoid are $AP = 1/{20}$ and $BD = 1. So, the area of the trapezoid $DPBQ$ is

$$A_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{24} \times \left( \frac{1}{20} + 1 \right) = \frac{1}{480}$$

Finally, we find the area of the two right triangles $BCD$ and $ABC$. The area of a right triangle is given by the formula

$$A = \frac{1}{2}bh$$

where $A$ is the area of the right triangle, $b$ is the base of the right triangle, and $h$ is the height of the right triangle.

In this case, the base of the right triangle $BCD$ is $BD = 1$ and the height of the right triangle $BCD$ is $AQ = 1/{24}$. So, the area of the right triangle $BCD$ is

$$A_3 = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times \frac{1}{24} = \frac{1}{48}$$

The area of the right triangle $ABC$ is also equal to $A_3$.

Now that we have found the areas of the four regions, we can find the ratio of the largest and smallest areas. The largest area is the area of the trapezoid $DPBQ$ and the smallest area is the area of the triangle $APQ$. So, the ratio of the largest and smallest areas is

$$\frac{A_2}{A_1} = \frac{1}{480} \times 480 = 1$$

Therefore, the answer to the problem is 1.",23
