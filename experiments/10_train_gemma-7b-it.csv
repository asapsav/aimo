229ee8,"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?",52,"**Answer:**

The parabola and the line intersect at the points $A(2k - \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k + l}) $ and $B(2k - \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k + l}) $. The distance from a point $(x_1, y_1)$ to the origin is given by the formula $d = \sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2}$. So, the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin are

$$d_A = \sqrt{(2k - \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k + l})^2 + (kx_2 - 2kx_1 + l))^2}$$

$$d_B = \sqrt{(2k - \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k + l})^2 + (kx_2 - 2kx_1 + l))^2}$$

The sum of squares of distances is

$$S = d_A^2 + d_B^2 = \sqrt{(2k - \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k + l})^2 + (kx_2 - 2kx_1 + l))^2}^2 + \sqrt{(2k - \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k + l})^2 + (kx_2 - 2kx_1 + l))^2}^2$$

Therefore, the answer is

$$S = \sqrt{(2k - \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k + l})^2 + (kx_2 - 2kx_1 + l))^2}^2 + \sqrt{(2k - \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k + l})^2 + (kx_2 - 2kx_1 + l))^2}^2$$",2
246d26,Each of the three-digits numbers $111$ to $999$ is coloured blue or yellow in such a way that the sum of any two (not necessarily different) yellow numbers is equal to a blue number. What is the maximum possible number of yellow numbers there can be?,250,"**Answer:**

The answer is $222$.

**Explanation:**

The key observation is that the sum of any two yellow numbers is always a blue number. Therefore, to maximize the number of yellow numbers, we need to find the maximum number of pairs of yellow numbers whose sum is a blue number.

The maximum number of pairs of yellow numbers whose sum is a blue number is $222$. This is because there are a total of $333$ pairs of two-digit numbers, and the sum of any two pairs of yellow numbers is always a blue number. Therefore, the maximum number of yellow numbers is $222$.",222

430b63,What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?,800,"The answer is:

**Explanation:**

**1. Find the relationship between $x$ and $y$:**

The given inequality $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as:

$$-40 \leq x-2y \leq 40$$

$$-40-2y \leq x \leq 40+2y$$

$$2y \leq x \leq 40+2y$$

This relationship between $x$ and $y$ will be useful later.

**2. Find the minimum value of the expression:**

We want to minimize the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. To do this, we need to find the values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the relationship above and minimize the expression.

We know that the minimum value of $x^2$ and $y^2$ is 0, so we can substitute these values into the expression:

$$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(0)+5(0)-8(0) = 0$$

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0.",0
5277ed,There exists a unique increasing geometric sequence of five 2-digit positive integers. What is their sum?,211,"The answer is 111.

**Here's the solution:**

1. Identify the first term of the sequence. To do this, find the smallest 2-digit number that fits the sequence. In this case, the first term is 11.
2. Find the common difference between consecutive terms in the sequence. This is 2.
3. Use the formula for the sum of an increasing geometric sequence to find the sum of the sequence. The formula is:

S = a(1 - r^-n) / (1 - r)

where S is the sum of the sequence, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

S = 11(1 - 2^-5) / (1 - 2)

S = 111

Therefore, the sum of the sequence is 111.",111
739bc9,For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?,199,"The answer is $m=2$.

**Explanation:**

The equation

$$\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$$

is equivalent to

$$\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100} = n \text{ for some integer } n$$

where $n$ is the integer part of $\frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, it must be that $n=1$. This is because the equation has a total of $2n+1$ solutions, and for the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, $2n+1=4$.

Therefore, the answer is $m=2$.",2
82e2a0,"Suppose that we roll four 6-sided fair dice with faces numbered 1 to~6. Let $a/b$ be the probability that the highest roll is a 5, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $a + b$.",185,"**Answer:**

The probability of rolling a 5 on a single die is 1/6. To get the highest roll to be 5, we need to roll at least one 5 and not roll any 6s. The probability of rolling a 5 on a single die is 1/6 and the probability of rolling a 6 on a single die is 1/6. So, the probability of not rolling a 6 on a single die is 5/6. The probability of rolling at least one 5 on four rolls is 1 - (5/6)<sup>4</sup>. Therefore, $a = 1$ and $b = 6$, so $a + b = 7$.

**Therefore, the answer is 7.**",7
8ee6f3,"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?",320,"**Answer:**

The given equation is:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

This equation is satisfied if and only if:

$$\vert x + y \vert = 10$$

$$\vert x - y \vert = 10$$

$$\vert x \vert = 8$$

$$\vert y \vert = 8$$

These equations define a convex polygon with vertices at:

$$\left(-8, -8\right), \left(-8, 8\right), \left(8, 8\right), \left(8, -8\right)$$

The area of this polygon is given by the formula:

$$A = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$$

where $A$ is the area of the polygon, $s$ is the length of the inscribed square, $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the lengths of the sides of the inscribed triangle.

Using the above formula, we can find the area of the polygon as:

$$A = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{16(16-10)(16-8)(16-8)} = 16$$

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying the given equation is 16 square units.",16
bedda4,Let $ABCD$ be a unit square. Let $P$ be the point on $AB$ such that $|AP| = 1/{20}$ and let $Q$ be the point on $AD$ such that $|AQ| = 1/{24}$. The lines $DP$ and $BQ$ divide the square into four regions. Find the ratio between the areas of the largest region and the smallest region.,480,"**Answer:**

The key to solving this problem is to find the areas of the four regions and then find the ratio of the largest and smallest areas.

**1. Find the area of the triangle APQ:**

The area of a triangle is given by the formula:

$$A = \frac{1}{2}bh$$

where $A$ is the area, $b$ is the base, and $h$ is the height.

In this case, the base of the triangle is $AP = 1/{20}$ and the height is $AQ = 1/{24}$. So, the area of the triangle is:

$$A_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{20} \times \frac{1}{24} = \frac{1}{480}$$

**2. Find the area of the rectangle DPQ:**

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

$$A = lw$$

where $A$ is the area, $l$ is the length, and $w$ is the width.

In this case, the length of the rectangle is $DP = 1 - |AP| = 1 - 1/{20} = 19/20$ and the width is $AQ = 1/{24}$. So, the area of the rectangle is:

$$A_2 = 19/20 \times \frac{1}{24} = \frac{19}{480}$$

**3. Find the area of the triangle CBD:**

The area of a triangle is given by the formula:

$$A = \frac{1}{2}bh$$

where $A$ is the area, $b$ is the base, and $h$ is the height.

In this case, the base of the triangle is $CB = 1$ and the height is $BD = 1 - |AQ| = 1 - 1/{24} = 23/24. So, the area of the triangle is:

$$A_3 = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times \frac{23}{24} = \frac{23}{480}$$

**4. Find the area of the largest region:**

The largest region is the rectangle DPQ. So, the area of the largest region is $A_2 = 19/480$.

**5. Find the area of the smallest region:**

The smallest region is the triangle APQ. So, the area of the smallest region is $A_1 = 1/480$.

**Ratio of the areas:**

The ratio of the areas of the largest and smallest regions is:

$$\frac{A_2}{A_1} = \frac{19/480}{1/480} = 19$$

Therefore, the ratio between the areas of the largest and smallest regions is 19.",19
d7e9c9,A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$.,199,"**Answer:**
The solution to this problem involves a careful analysis of the function's behavior and the identification of a pattern. Here's the process:

1. **Understanding the first condition:**
   - The function $f$ is applied three times to the input number $n$, and the result is always $8n-7$.
   - This condition suggests that $f$ is a function that increases the input by a factor of 8 and then subtracts 7.

2. **Analyzing the second condition:**
   - For any positive integer $n$, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
   - This condition implies that $f(n)$ is even for all positive integers $n$.

3. **Finding the pattern:**
   - We notice that the function's behavior is repetitive. If we apply $f$ to a number, the result is always an even number that is multiples of 8.
   - The number of iterations of $f$ determines the multiple of 8, and the number of iterations is always increasing by 2.

4. **Calculating $f(100)$:**
   - To calculate $f(100)$, we need to find the number of iterations of $f$ that will result in a multiple of 8 that is less than or equal to 100.
   - This number is 12.
   - Therefore, $f(100)=8(12)-7=96-7=89$.

Therefore, the answer is 89.",89
