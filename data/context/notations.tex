\maketitle

This is a compendium of things which we would normally explain in maths competitions for teenaged schoolchildren.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Established mathematical notation will be used.
    
    \item We might use a colon or a vertical line as a separator in set notation so $\{x \mid x \in \mathbb{Z}, x > 0\} = \{y : y \in \mathbb{Z}, y > 0\}$.
    
    \item Floor and ceiling notation, so for $x$ a real number we let $\lfloor x \rfloor = \max\{z \mid z \in \mathbb{Z}, z \leq x\}$. Similarly, $\lceil x \rceil = \min\{z \mid z \in \mathbb{Z}, z \geq x\}$.
    
    \item Fractional part notation. If $x$ is a real number, we define $\{x\}$ to mean $x - \lfloor x \rfloor$.
    
    \item We write a line over a non-negative integer written in base 10 notation to indicate that it is being viewed as a string of digits rather than a number. Thus the second digit of $1729$ is $7$ but $1729$ does not have a second digit because it is an integer.
    
    \item We allow a phrase such as $x$ is a 3-digit positive integer to mean that if written in Arabic notation as $x = a_m a_{m-1} \ldots a_1 a_0$ with all $a_i$ digits and $a_m \neq 0$, then $n = m$. We allow ``the sum of the digits of $n$'' to mean: write $n$ in Arabic base 10 notation and then sum the digits.
    
    \item We allow informal probability language such as: a point is chosen uniformly at random in the interval $[0,1]$.
    
    \item We use $(n)$ to denote the number of ways of choosing $r$ things from $n$ things.
    
    \item The sum over the empty set is 0 and the product over the empty set is 1.
    
    \item We use an ellipsis to denote an obvious pattern, either on the line of print of midline (as appropriate) so the set of the first $n$ positive integers can be written $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ and their sum is $1 + 2 + \ldots + n$.
    
    \item For integers $m, n$, then $m^n$ denotes $(m^n)$.
    
    \item $m^0 = 1$ for all integers $m$ (including 0) if doing combinatorial enumeration. If $x$ is real then $x^0$ needs to be clarified if $x = 0$.
    
    \item British or American versions of English can be used. Thus ``highest common factor'' means the same as ``greatest common divisor''.
    
    \item A prefix or subscript may be used to indicate features of a triangle associated with vertices. Thus triangle $ABC$ has three altitudes, and the one dropped from $A$ could be denoted the altitude through $A$, the $A$-altitude or the altitude $a$. Similarly for median lines.
    
    \item If the term \textit{natural number} is used, then it will be made clear if 0 is a natural number.
    
    \item `:=` means 'is defined to be equal to'.
\end{enumerate}

\hline
\textbf{id} & \textbf{problem} & \textbf{answer} \\ \hline
229ee8 & Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin? & 52 \\ \hline
246d26 & Each of the three-digits numbers $111$ to $999$ is coloured blue or yellow in such a way that the sum of any two (not necessarily different) yellow numbers is equal to a blue number. What is the maximum possible number of yellow numbers there can be? & 250 \\ \hline
2fc4ad & Let the `sparkle' operation on positive integer $n$ consist of calculating the sum of the digits of $n$ and taking its factorial, e.g. the sparkle of 13 is $4! = 24$. A robot starts with a positive integer on a blackboard, then after each second for the rest of eternity, replaces the number on the board with its sparkle. For some `special' numbers, if they're the first number, then eventually every number that appears will be less than 6. How many such special numbers are there with at most 36 digits? & 702 \\ \hline
430b63 & What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$? & 800 \\ \hline
5277ed & There exists a unique increasing geometric sequence of five 2-digit positive integers. What is their sum? & 211 \\ \hline
739bc9 & For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions? & 199 \\ \hline
82e2a0 & Suppose that we roll four 6-sided fair dice with faces numbered 1 to~6. Let $a/b$ be the probability that the highest roll is a 5, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $a + b$. & 185 \\ \hline
8ee6f3 & The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon? & 320 \\ \hline
bedda4 & Let $ABCD$ be a unit square. Let $P$ be the point on $AB$ such that $|AP| = 1/{20}$ and let $Q$ be the point on $AD$ such that $|AQ| = 1/{24}$. The lines $DP$ and $BQ$ divide the square into four regions. Find the ratio between the areas of the largest region and the smallest region. & 480 \\ \hline
d7e9c9 & A function $f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$. & 199 \\ \hline
